🚀 About Me
💡 My Journey in Tech
My path in technology began at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, where I pursued a 🎓 Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. Since then, I’ve been deeply focused on crafting innovative and impactful solutions through code.

🛠️ With hands-on experience in both hardware and software, I've developed a solid foundation in full-stack development. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems, building intuitive user experiences, and creating efficient systems from the ground up.

🌐 I enjoy working across the stack — from responsive, accessible front-end designs to dynamic, data-driven backend architectures.

🎮 Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring new tools, diving into dev tutorials, or gaming to recharge.
